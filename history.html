        <p class="code-p">At age 32 when he died, Alexander the Great had conquered and created the largest land-based empire the world has ever seen. It stretched from the Balkans to Pakistan.

  In 323 BC, Alexander fell ill and, after 12 days of excruciating pain, he seemingly passed away.

  However, his corpse didn’t show any signs of rot or decomposition for a whole six days.

  Modern-day scientists believe Alexander suffered from the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

  They believe that when he “died” he was actually just paralyzed and mentally aware. Basically, he was horrifically buried alive</p>

        <p class="code-p">Marcus Licinius Crassus was known as the wealthiest man in Rome during his life.

The son of a Consul of Rome, Crassus fought in Sulla’s Civil War, played a key part in defeating Spartacus and ending the Third Servile War, and formed the first Triumvirate with Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great.After an unsuccessful parley for peace with the Parthian leaders, Crassus was killed. The Parthians poured molten gold down his throat, as a symbol of his thirst for wealth.

Some even say that his gilded head and hands were sent to the Parthian King to keep as trophies of his victory against Crassus and Rome.</p>

        <p class="code-p">It’s fair to say that Edison was one of the world’s most notorious intellectual property thieves.

Of the 1,093 things he smashed a patent on, he stole near enough most of them off real geniuses like Nikola Tesla, Wilhelm Rontgen, and Joseph Swan – the latter of whom originally invented the lightbulb!.</p>

        <p class="code-p">Fought between Britain and Zanzibar, and known as the Anglo-Zanzibar War, this war occurred on August 27, 1896.

It was all over the ascension of the next Sultan in Zanzibar and resulted in a British victory..</p>
